# EEG-Based Brain-Operated Typewriting Machine

Typewritnig machine based on EEG signal processing

- Implemented based on two SVM and LDA algorithms for training prediction models 
  and also WPGMA and UPGMA algorithms for clustering EEG channels

- You can find the datasets that have used to train the models in the "dataset" folder.
